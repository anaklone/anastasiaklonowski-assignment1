  Assignment #1 - REMEMBER TO FOLLOW THE STYLE GUIDE

  1. Fork your own version of this repo
  2. Create a branch named <your-name>-assignment1 (in my case it would be mattbowytz-assignment1)
  3. Basing your code off of the below example, tell me a little bit about yourself

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Assignment 1</title>
    <!-- I don't like Times New Roman very much, so I changed the font.-->
    <style type="text/css">
      body {font-family: monospace;}
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!

    <ul>
      <li>In high school, I took the College In High School version of the Introduction to Web Design course at Pitt.  I worked with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</li>
      <li>During my first year in the engineering school, we had a short unit on HTML in Engineering Computing.</li>
      <li>This past summer, I worked my first co-op rotation.  As part of the projects I worked on, I learned about jQuery and AJAX, SQL databases, and Apache servers.</li>
      <li>During my free time, I learned more about HTML5 because I thought it was super cool.</li>
      <li>I've mostly taught myself HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX by googling and reading documentation, so I am excited to gain a thorough understanding of these topics through this course.</li>
